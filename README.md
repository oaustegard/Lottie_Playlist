    1. For each track: 
        1. App downloads 64x64 album cover
        1. App gets dominant color(s?) of album cover, adds to dataframe
    1. App loads next 100 tracks into dataframe, repeat
1. App sorts dataframe by album dominant color(s)
1. App displays list of tracks/album/artist with cover as 
1. App asks user for new playlist name
